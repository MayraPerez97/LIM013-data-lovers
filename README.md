About the research

Metodology and findings:

Four face-to-face interview and seven qualitative surveys were conducted with potential users. On one hand, a little more than fifty per cent of our sample, indicated being Rick & Morty's fan. On the other hand, the rest of people indicated only 'liked' it. In addition to this, a range between 21 and 26 years old was identified as an age group. However, when making a comparison with universal statistics, the target market that usually watches this sitcom is between the ages of 25 and 35. Therefore, combining both findings, it was established that our target includes any person, without distinguishing age, who is characterized by being 'jovial', a significant personality trait among people who meet the aforementioned age ranges.
